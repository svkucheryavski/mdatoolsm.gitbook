# Principal Component Analysis

In this chapter we will show how to use PCA implemented in the *mdatools*. Besides that we use PCA examples to introduce some principles, which a common for any modelling method available in this toolbox, such as, for example, model and result objects, showing performance statistics, validation, different kinds of plots, and so on.

Principal component analysis decomposes a data matrix **X** into a combination of three matrices: **X** = **TP^T** + **E**. Here **P** is a matrix with unit vectors, defined in the original variables space. The unit vectors form a new basis, which is used to project all data points into.
