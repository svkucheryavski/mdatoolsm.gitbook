# Principal Component Analysis

In this chapter we will show how to use PCA method implemented in the *mdatools*. Besides that, we will use PCA examples to introduce some principles, which are common for most of the other methods (e.g. PLS, SIMCA, PLS-DA, etc.) available in this toolbox. This includes such things as model and result objects, showing performance statistics for models and results, validation, different kinds of plots, and so on.

Principal component analysis is one of the methods that decompose a data matrix **X** into a combination of three matrices: **X** = **TP'** + **E**. Here **P** is a matrix with unit vectors, defined in the original variables space. The unit vectors form a new basis, which is used to project all data points into. Matrix **T** contains coordinates of the projections. Matrix **E** contains residuals — difference between position of projected data points and their original locations.

In terms of PCA, the unit-vectors defining the new coordinate space are called *loadings* and the coordinate axes oriented alongside the loadings are *Principal Components* (PC). The coordinates of data points projected to the principal components are *scores*. There are several other methods, such as *Projection Pursuit* (PP), *Independent Component Analysis* (ICA) and some others,  that work in a similar way and resulting in the data decomposition shown above. The principal difference among the methods is the way they find orientation of the unit-vectors. Thus, PCA find them as directions of maximum variance of data points, plus all PCA loadings are orthogonal to each other.
