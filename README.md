This is a user guide for [*mdatoolsm*](https://github.com/svkucheryavski/mdatoolsm) â€” a free and open source MATLAB toolbox for analysis of spectral and other kind of experimental data based on methods widespread in Chemometrics. 

It is recommended to start learning the toolbox with a Quick start guide which gives a brief overview of basic functionality and allows you to start working with the toolbox after 30 minutes. Then just continue with other topics of the tutorial to get acquainted with all features and details.

The toolbox was tested using MATLAB 2012b and should also work on later versions. For the basic functionality you do not need any toolbox installed. All methods were tested using well-known datasets. However there still could be some bugs, in this case please report to [svkucheryavski@gmail.com](mailto:svkucheryavski@gmail.com).
