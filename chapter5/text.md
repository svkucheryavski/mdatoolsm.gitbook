# Multiple linear regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a simplest method, which can be used for relating a multivariate dataset **X** with a vector of response values **y** as a linear combination: . In its simplest form (meaning without constraints, penalties, etc.) the solution can be found by using one line of MATLAB code.

```matlab
b = y \ X
```
